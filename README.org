* zwm

X11 window manager built in Zig.

** Developing

Run window manager with ~Xephyr~:

#+begin_src bash
# Launch a Xephyr window with DISPLAY set to :1
Xephyr -br -ac -noreset -screen 800x600 :1

# Launch wm on the new display
DISPLAY=:1 zig-out/bin/zwm
#+end_src

** Tasks

*** TODO Consider becoming non-reparenting

May make things much simpler, and we probably don't need any window decorations
anyways
